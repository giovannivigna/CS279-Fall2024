# Tooling Examples

These are three simple challenges. 

The first one is a basic command injection in a socket program. it helps introduce the concept of socket programming and show how to connect to it using tools like Netcat. 
Then, this example will highlight issues like timeouts and introduce Pwntools, demonstrating how to use it. 
The students will solve the command injection by interacting with the source code. 
The second phase of this challenge involves input sanitization, where the Python debugger (pdb) will be introduced. 
This example will give them a solid understanding of CTF challenges, reading source code, and the use of Netcat, Pwntools, and pdb.

The second challenge is a simple web challenge involving cookie manipulation. First, the instructor introduces the students to Chrome DevTools, and then the instructor will demonstrate how to use Burp Suite to solve it. 
The challenge itself is straightforwardâ€”the main goal here is to introduce the basics of both tools.

The third challenge is a simple C program with a buffer overflow. 
It will introduce GDB, and will explain how to exploit the vulnerability.
